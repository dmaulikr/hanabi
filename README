This is a Hanabi solver. It allows one to explore the game space of Hanabi.

Hanabi: http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98778/hanabi

To run, use Xcode 6. (This Hanabi solver is an iPad app, mostly in Swift, targeted for iOS 7.1+.)

What you can do:
--Simulate many games to get statistics.
--Walk through a single game to see how the AI plays it.
--Single games are reproducible via seeds.

What you can't do, yet:
--Enter a custom deck/deal to analyze.
--Change number of players in the game.
--Select AIs other than one that cheats. =)
--Select an AI that mimics (good) human play.

AIs:
• Omniscient: Cheats (knowledge of own hand).
  • Games lost: ~3%.
  • Time: ?
--Pure Info: (in progress) ??
--AlwaysDiscardElf: (may not work anymore) Discards every turn. Was for testing.

Other plans:
• Refactor code. (In progress.)
• Faster games?

Code structure:
• SolverElf simulates/manages the games. For each turn, she asks an AI what to do.

This is on GitHub as a personal backup, though I don't mind sharing. If you want to understand the code and it's not clear, please ask. I'm a self-taught coder, and I want to get better.
