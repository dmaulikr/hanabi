This is a Hanabi solver. It allows one to explore the game space of Hanabi.

Hanabi: http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98778/hanabi

How to build: This is an iPad app, written mostly in Swift, targeted for iOS 7.1+. As of this writing, to build you'll need the latest Xcode beta.

What users can currently do: The app has two modes: 1) solve games, 2) walk through a single game. The former is to see how an AI does overall. The latter is to explore a specific game/deal of Hanabi. The latter is reproducible via seeds.

What you can't do yet but I agree it's a good idea:
--Select AIs other than one that cheats. =)
--Enter a custom deck/deal to analyze.
--Select an AI that mimics (good) human play.
--Change number of players in the game.

AIs:
--Omniscient: Cheats (knowledge of own hand). Loses ~3% of games.
--Pure Info: (in progress) ??
--AlwaysDiscardElf: (may not work anymore) Discards every turn. Was for testing.

Speed optimization:
--None yet. Low priority.

Understanding the code:
While the source code is available here, this is currently a project just for myself. If you still wish to use the code and something isn't clear, you can ask me.
I'm a self-taught coder, and I want to get better. I apologize if the code is hard to follow. Constructive criticism is appreciated. As of right now (0.1.1 (build 2)), I'm in the middle of adopting a new coding convention (non-Hungarian). Also, I'm still building up a lot of the features and UI. So there will be a lot of changes for the foreseeable future.
