    // The options the card could be, based on what is seen and has been clued. This is like a 2D array, but the first part is unordered. Each color has an array of the possible card numbers (1â€“5), so each element corresponds to a card (e.g., B1). Each element has the number of ways the card back could be that card. E.g., if there are 3 unseen B1s, then this would be 3. If a B1 was played and another was discarded, this would be 1.
